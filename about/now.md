## Family

I'm living in Apex, NC with my wife, our children (2 and newborn), and our dog.

We believe in Jesus and attend a local presbyterian church.

## Work

I am a Software Engineer at CrowdStrike, working on their macOS sensor team.

## Bagpipes

I play with the Wake and Distict Pipe Band. I serve as the pipe major in the grade 4 competiton circle.

I am also working on developing a custom bagpipe music notation language. It is similar to ABC notation, but focused specifically on the eccentricities of pipe music.

## Other

I am attempting to learn the language toki pona.
