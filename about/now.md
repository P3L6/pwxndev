## Family

I'm living in Apex, NC with my wife, our child (2), and our dog.
We are expecting our second child in October.

We believe in Jesus and attend a local presbyterian church.

## Work

I am a Senior macOS Engineer at Boombox, developing their desktop file sync application.

## Bagpipes

I play with the Wake and Distict Pipe Band. I serve as the pipe major in the grade 4 competiton circle.

I am also working on developing a custom bagpipe music notation language. It is similar to ABC notation, but focused specifically on the eccentricities of pipe music.

## Other

I am attempting to learn the language toki pona, but struggling to keep up with it.

I am reducing my red meat intake, shooting for only two servings per week.
