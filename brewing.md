# Welcome to Bowline Brewing

I've named my homebrew adventures after my favorite knot, the bowline!
I also try to name each style of beer after a knot as well.

## Setup

I brew 5 gallon batches every few months, and package into a two tap kegerator mini fridge. I mostly make recipes from the book, _Brewing Classic Styles_.
I use a converted cooler mash tun to brew all grain batches.

## On Tap

1. Nothing.

I have not been brewing lately, and so have nothing on tap. Maybe I'll get some more going when summer comes around

## Up Next

???

# Past Brews

### #17 Peach Wheat
Wheat pear using whole peaches from the palisade peach festival.

### #16 Spruce Ale
Another recipe from the homebrew magazine, using new spruce tips from my neighbor's tree.

### #15 Porter (Prusik)
Remake of the previous porter.

### #14 Lime Hefe (Half hitch)
This one was from the homebrew magazine, made by adding simply limeade to the brew.

### #13 Saison (Sheepshank)
Used a yeast blend from the white labs yeast vault for this.

### #12 Cream Ale
This one was a clone of Terrapin's Golden ale

### #11 English Chili Pepper Ale (Hangman's Noose)
An English blonde ale mashup, with chili peppers. For a contest at Mockery Brewing.

### #10 Scottish Ale (Carrick Bend)
First Submission to a contest.

### #9 Smoke Ale
First time using a starter with a stir plate. Based on something I tried at the White Labs tap room. Followed the Rauchbier recipe, but used WLP003 and fermented as an ale instead of lagering.

### #8 Red Ale (Reef Knot)
First time brewing in the morning instead of afternoon/evening. I'll try to do that again, it was enjoyable.
Used the Irish red ale recipe, but with Imperial Flagship yeast (WLP001). Worked out well.

### #7 Extra Special Bitter (Windsor)
Pretty Good.

### #6 Robust Porter (Prusik)
First beer using all grain, with the brew in a bag method.
The best beer I'd made yet, by a long shot.

### #5 American Ipa
First recipe from _Brewing Classic Styles_. Under-fermented and not much at all like an IPA. Very sweet.

### #4 Amber Ale
First Kegged beer! No more bottling!
From the Clone book.

### #3 Brown Ale
Moose Drool Clone from the clone book.

### #2 Scottish Ale

### #1 Sweet Stout
The first brew, made with my Father and Brother. Under-carbonated.
