## Ingredients
* 4 cans biscuits
* 1 C sugar
* 1 C brown sugar
* 4 T Cinnamon
* 1 Stick margarine

## Directions
1. Cut biscuits into quarters. 
2. Mix sugars and cinnamon in plastic bag.
3. Drop quarters into bag and coat well
4. Place into dutch oven
5. Melt margarine in the lid and pour over quarters
6. Bake 350 for 35 min. 

Line the Dutch with foil to make getting it out easier.  
Sort of worked indoors, but ended up a quite on the raw side, even after extended cooking.   
Making a half recipe works just fine.
