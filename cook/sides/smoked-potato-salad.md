layout: recipe
---

50/50 mayo, sour cream
spices? 
shredded cheese

Double cook potatoes: cut, parboil, bake. 
Liquid smoke when boiling?

## Attempt 1
Half bag of potato

Using smoker after parboil, since anyways. Boiled too long maybe for pre cuts. Might not need too?

1/4 c each mayo cream

1/2 t each 
Chili pow
Lawry salt
Paprika 
Cayenne 
Cumin

1/2 c cheese

Mixed cheese in, then sauce. 
Used about 2/3 of sauce. 

Results. Good
More cheese would be good. A bit more sauce, but one spice was overpowering it. We think chili powder, leave that out. Maybe less paprika.
