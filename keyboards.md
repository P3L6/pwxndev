Currently my main keyboard is a tada68, built from the kit.

I use qmk firmware. You can see my custom layouts here:
* [tada68](https://github.com/pwxn/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/tada68/keymaps/paulLayout/keymap.c)
* ca66 (Excitedly waiting for group buy to ship!)
* [foobar](https://github.com/pwxn/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/foobarMacro/keymaps/default/keymap.c)
* [gherkin for bagpipe authoring](https://github.com/pwxn/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/gherkin/keymaps/ePipes/keymap.c)
