title: Big ugly salmon
meal: dinner
---

Make a aluminum foil boat, fold up the sides of a big piece. (fold in first if needed smaller)

lay salmon in boat. ideally no skin. ( recipe scale about .5 by 1.5 feet )
squeeze 2 or 3 lemons on top
spice with salt, pepper and lots of dill weed ( looks almost like a chia pet)
cover with mayo, like frosting a cake. it'll mix up with the dill.
put a little extra dill on top for class

you'll need foil boat lids as well.
grill that sucker. 10 or 15 minutes or something.
