3. Cover and refrigerate overnight. This is important for blending of flavors. The dough can be refrigerated for several days or frozen.

5. Scoop 1 teaspoon of dough for each cookie onto un-greased cookie sheet. Bake for 10-13 min.

> These delicious cookies were served warm at about 4pm when we returned to our clipper ship after an afternoon adventure on zodiacs in Antarctica. Our daughter became such a fan of these cookies that she requested they be served instead of cake at her wedding. I froze the dough in Colorado and baked the cookies in Tortola, BVI. They were a hit!
