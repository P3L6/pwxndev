|| Ingredients |
|-:|-|
50/50 mix | mayo, sour cream
&nbsp; | spices?
&nbsp; | shredded cheese

## Directions

1. Double cook potatoes: cut, parboil, bake.
   2. Liquid smoke when boiling?

## Attempt 1

Half bag of potato

Using smoker after parboil, since running anyways. Boiled too long maybe for pre cuts. Might not need to?

1/4 c each mayo cream

1/2 t each
Chili pow
Lawry salt
Paprika
Cayenne
Cumin

1/2 c cheese

Mixed cheese in, then sauce.
Used about 2/3 of sauce.

Results. Good
More cheese would be good. A bit more sauce, but one spice was overpowering it. We think chili powder, leave that out. Maybe less paprika.
