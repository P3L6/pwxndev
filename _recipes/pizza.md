## Ingredients
* 1 tspn instant or rapid rise yeast
* 3 cups all purpose or bread flour
* 2 tspns coarse salt, plus extra for sprinkling
* 1 to 1 1/4 cups water
* 2 tablspns plus 1 tspn olive oil

## Directions
makes 1 large or 2 small pizzas

combine 1/2 the flour w the salt and yeast and stir to blend. Add 1 cup water and 2 tblspn olive oile; stir w wooden spoon til smooth. Add remaining flour a bit at a time. When mixture is too stiff to stir w spoon, begin kneading, adding as little flour as possible- just enough to keep it from being a skicky mess. Knead until smooth but quite moist, about 10 min. Turn into a dough ball. grease a bowl w remaining olive oil, place dough in, cover w plastic wrap or damp cloth and let rise in warm area until dough doubles in size (1-2 hrs). Or in the fridge for 6-8 hrs.

you can grill or bake- the hotter the better. We had the ovens at 500 deg and baked for approx 6-12 min.  Here's how I altered the recipe to make it more flavorful... I mixed whole wheat flour and white, I used a flavored olive oil (I think it was basil, or you could use garlic/rosemary/etc), I sprinkled a large amnt of italian seasoning from my pantry.

Other ideas from my cookbook: add fresh cracked black pepper, add 1 tbsp pureed cooked garlic, add fresh herbs, add 1/4 or 1/2 cup of minced procuitto, ham, or bacon.

once you are ready to roll it out, get your hands wet and use a lightly floured surface. The thinner the better... and don't handle too much. After you make this a couple of times, you'll see what you like and will be able to change to your taste. enjoy!
