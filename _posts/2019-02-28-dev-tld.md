Google is now allowing registrations for their .dev top level domain! They had recently been in an early access period that has now ended.

So I'm migrating this blog from .xyz to .dev. The old site should forward for now, and I'll decide later whether to renew it next year. I am very happy that they have opened up the .dev domains, as I think it much better represents what I am trying to do with this blog and page. My default online alias is fairly unique, but I'm still glad I was able to grab pwxn.dev at the beginning of the cycle before other people got to it.

Some may be wondering about the origins of pwxn. It really just comes from a day in high school where I asked a friend to write my name on my assignment for me. He begrudgingly did so, but in his own words, "I'm probably going to spell it wrong." The result was Pwxn, which I found was a mixture of short, and usually available in online forums. So I've just been using it since then. I don't always manage to get it, but I often do.
