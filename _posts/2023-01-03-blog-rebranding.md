I've been using the online handle `pwxn` for a long time now, and it is starting to get a bit stale. 
I've mentioned it's origins in [an earlier blog post](/2019/02/28/dev-tld), but nobody generally knows what it means since it was an inside joke from way back in high school.

However, I have enjoyed that it was both short and unique, usually being available when signing up for new services. 
So I've been on the hunt for a new short unique handle for some time now. 
Eventually, I came up with `p3l6`, which is "PaulLanders" shortened in the same style as k8s or i18n. 
This was available as a .dev domain, and a github username. In fact, a brief search doesn't turn up anyone else using it at this time. 

I like this new one very much, it is unique, and remains short: still four characters, but might be look even shorter depending on the font! 

I think it also sounds a bit like a Star Wars droid identifier.
