title: Wood Working
---

Another of my hobbies is working with wood in my small garage shop. 
I like to work on various projects, many of which support my other hobbies, such as [A portable rack for bagpipes](/2020/11/24/pipe-rack/).

The main bench I'm working from right now is a modified [Paulk Workbench](https://thesmartwoodshop.com). 
I think it is a great design because it collapses against the wall when I am not working on projects, to allow my car into the garage. 

Many of my other projects end up on my [instagram page](https://instagram.com/pwxn.dev).
