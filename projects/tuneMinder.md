This project is still under development, but the basic concept is this:

It will be an app for your phone, wherein you can remember the starts of the bagpipe tunes you have previously memorized. It will show you the first two bars of any song you have previously learned. You'll have to program them in, of course! The current plan is load them from a formatted json file, for example one in a github repository that you can modify as you add things to your repertoire. I am also planning to do a watch app for this, to have easy access on your wrist.
