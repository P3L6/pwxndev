Trivia Tracker is an app for iPhone and iPad developed by Paul Landers.

It is a score tracker; as you watch a trivia episode[^1] and call out answers, you can use the app to mark whether or not you were correct. Then, at the end you can compare your score to your friends and family, or the contestants themselves!
