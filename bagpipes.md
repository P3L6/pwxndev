Playing bagpipes is one of my primary hobbies! I play performances, for fun, and for competition.

I'm proud to play in the [Wake and District Pipe Band](https://raleighpipeband.com) in Raleigh, NC.

When I compete solo, I am at the grade 3 level. 

I sometimes upload bagpipe videos to my [youtube channel](/accounts).
