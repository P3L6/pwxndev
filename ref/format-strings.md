## Placeholders
`%[parameter][flags][width][.precision][length]type`

### [parameter]
`n$` - n is the number of the parameter to use. allows using parameters out of order, or multiple times. one-based. if using, must use for all placeholders in string.

### [flags]
`+`     always denote the sign of a number.
`space` prefixes non-negative signed numbers with a space ( where a minus would be ).
`-`     left-align the output of this placeholder ( default is right ).
`#`     alternate form. (g,G trailing zeros allowed)(f,F,e,E,g,G always has decimal point)(o,x,X add 0,0x,0X, to beginning).
`0`     use 0 to pad a field when width is defined.

### [width]
specify minimum number of characters to output.

### [.precision]
specify digits to the right of the decimal or number of string characters.

### [length]
`hh`  expect an int-sized integer promoted from char.
`h`   expect an int-sized integer promoted from short.
`l`   expect a long-sized integer.
`ll`  expect a long long-sized integer.
`L`   expect a long double.
`z`   expect a size_t-sized integer.
`j`   expect a intmax_t-sized integer.
`t`   expect a ptrdiff_t-sized integer.

### type
`d`  `i`  signed decimal number.
`u`    unsigned decimal number.
`f`  `F`  double normal notation.
`e`  `E`  double exponent notation.
`g`  `G`  double in either notation, whichever is more appropriate.
`x`  `X`  unsigned int in hexidecimal.
`o`    unsigned int in octal.
`s`    null terminated string.
`c`    char.
`p`    void* .
`n`    print nothing, write number of characters written into an integer pointer.
`%`    literal %, no flags accepted.
