* makefiles must use tabs, not spaces
* make runs each line as a subprocess: to cd somewhere, have the action on same line

## Automatic variables
```
targets : prerequisites | order-only prerequisites
    order-only prerequisites do not trigger a build of this rule when changed
    @command: using the at sign will suppress the echo of line prior to executing it
    %.c in rule declaration is a wildcard match, either for the target or prerequisite
```

| Variable | References                                |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `$@` |  file name of the target. |
| `$%` |  target member name, when target is an archive member. empty otherwise. |
| `$<` |  name of first prerequisite. |
| `$?` |  names of all prerequisites that are newer than target. |
| `$^` |  names of all prerequisites, no duplicates, no order-only prerequisites. |
| `$+` |  like '$^' but duplicates can exist. |
| `$|` | names of all order-only prerequisites. |
| `$*` |  stem of pattern match. should generally avoid except for implicit rules. |

## Sample makefile
```makefile
# builds all cpp and java files in directory
SRC=$(wildcard *.cpp)
EXEC=$(SRC:.cpp=)

JAVA_SRC=$(wildcard *.java)
JAVA_CLASS=$(JAVA_SRC:.java=.class)

all:cpp java

cpp:$(EXEC)

java:$(JAVA_CLASS)

#default build thingy for cpp
%:%.cpp
	g++ -Wall -o $@ $^

#default build thingy for java
%.class:%.java
	javac $^

clean:
	rm -rf $(EXEC)
	rm -rf $(JAVA_CLASS)
```
